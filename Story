 The world had mutated with earth’s elements and now more than 90% of population has elements as their secret weapons the world’s best facility to train these people has made people to inherit their inner power while the second best taught people how to be the one to save someone the most major elements are “Earth, Fire, Water and Air” the one who could beat them is the time element which in this whole era was given to only one person There is a story that the one who got the time element started with the Insanity element and this is the story of me who had no element had to be  the one of the best of the best facility In India my friends elements are : “void, light speed”(authors note: these three people are the protagonists probably there will be one more) as time went by we all were in the best facility and our code names are: Atom, Strangelet and tesla As a team we were the people who could compete with the four elements at once. Darkness and light element have rivalled each other for a long time and the people who used it was just like me. Element-less. 

Atom: “Today is the day I am going to get my first mission”
Tesla: “As a non-elemental person you will get the lowest rank mission”
Strangelet: “do not underestimate him he had already defeated you two times just with his skills who knows what type of hero he will become if he gets an element”
Tesla: “for the first time you are right”
After they went to the facility, Atom was called at the staff room to have given him some Information.
Staff member1: “Judging from your skills and keeping in mind that u have no elements you have been given an -SS class mission”
